; Post-processing knowledge file

; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; This file contains the knowledge related to post-processing, in the 
; form of lists and rules. This file is read by post-process.c at run-time. 
; Syntax of file:
;           line starting with ";" is a comment
;           commas are field delimiters 
;           any token beginning with the character @ is expanded to the set
;               of symbols it defined. e.g. one could write
; FOO: blah1 blah2 blah3
; thus defining a set FOO containing three strings. Then one could later write
; BAR: blah5 @FOO blah8
; which defines a set BAR containing 5 strings. 
; 
; Capitalized tokens are *required*, though if you feel like providing an
; empty list afterwards, that's your right.
