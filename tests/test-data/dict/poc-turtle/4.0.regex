% Want to match apostrophes, for abreviations (I'm I've, etc.) since these
% cannot be auto-split with the current splitter.  Also want to accept
% hyphenated words, and word with underbars in them.
%ANY-WORD:  /^[[:alnum:]_'-]+$/
%ANY-PUNCT:  /^[[:punct:]]+$/

% Match anything that doesn't match the above.
% Match anything that isn't white-space.
% Well ... actually, reject anything that begins or ends with
% punctuation. We do this, so that tokenize can split off the
% the affixes (trailing commas, etc) correctly.
%JUNK: /^[^[:punct:]][^[:space:]]+[^[:punct:]]$/
